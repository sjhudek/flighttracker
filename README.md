# Flight Tracker 

## Description 
The motivation for this project was learning how to work with a team in order to accomplish our goal to create a application where users could look up a flight based off certain criteria and the results would display the flight status information. Our team built this project because we wanted to apply our in class learnings to a real life situation. The problems our team solved connecting two server side API's to our website in order to make dynamic data display. What our team learned was how to delegate tasks and then be able to work there merge conflicts.

## User Story
As a traveler, I want to be able to easily look up the status of a flight on the flight tracker website, so that I can stay informed about its departure and arrival times.

## Acceptance Story
*As a user I should be able to enter my Airline, Flight Number, and Date and to search for the flight arrival and departure details.
*As a user I should be able to lookup the flight by entering the Airline, Flight Number, and Date and then the results should display that particular flight details such as arrival and departure details.
*I should be able to view the current status of the flight, indicating whether it is on time, delayed, or canceled.
*The website should display the expected duration of the flight.
*If there are any changes to the departure or arrival times, the flight tracker should provide notifications or alerts to keep me updated.
*The website should have a clear and intuitive user interface that allows me to easily access and understand the status information for my flight.
*The website should be mobile-friendly, ensuring that I can access the flight status information on my smartphone or tablet while on the *go.
